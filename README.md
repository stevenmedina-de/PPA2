This project uses CircleCI to create the CI server. The code is checked out from GitHub and ran automatically whenever new code is pushed.
The code for PPA2 is found in the PPA1 directory. To run the code, fork the PPA1 repository and create a new project in CircleCI. Choose
the forked code from the listings of repositories and CircleCI will build and test. Building and testing scripts are found within the
.circleci/config.yml file.
